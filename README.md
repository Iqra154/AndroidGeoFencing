# AndroidGeoFencing
## A geofencing sample app I created ,it does use Google's built-in Geofencing API.

#Features:
## Geofences persist outside application's state
## Geofence tracking continues even after you reset the phone or put the app in the background
## Can add/remove multiple geofences
## Custom name and radius for geofences
